2019-02-25: An error with archive.today resulted in missing a handful of tweets at the worst time. At least one of the missed tweets was deleted by Boogie following some backlash. The problem has been fixed.

2019-02-25: A second repo is available where all of the tweets the API can access are backed up as well. Find that here: https://github.com/absolute-beginner/pasttweetarchive

2019-03-04: Server dropped connection, so a few tweets were missed. I've collected the ones still available after the problem was noticed.
