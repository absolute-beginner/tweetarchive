2019-02-25: An error with archive.today resulted in missing a handful of tweets at the worst time. At least one of the missed tweets was deleted by Boogie following some backlash. The problem has been fixed.

2019-02-25: A second repo is available with all of the tweets the API can access were backed up as well. Find that here: https://github.com/absolute-beginner/pasttweetarchive
