Text of the tweet: @thelindsayellis @JennyENicholson @Totalbiscuit I dunno.  It seems subjective.

I find it a lot easier to discuss creative things with other creative people.  But clearly I have pretty terrible social anxiety eo maybe it's just me.

If you dont find that to be true for yourself i hope you respect it is true for me.
