Text of the tweet: @thelindsayellis @JennyENicholson @Totalbiscuit I certainly have friends outside the industry.  Most of them in fact.

I just find it quicker and easier to defend fellow creative types.  Artists, writers, etc.

Same as other gamers.  Or magic players.

It's not required.  But it helps.

Sorry if this is somehow offensive.
