Text of the tweet: @Sub6Snoopy @TokidokiBop Right.  What I said is that we should have kept fighting for another 5 years and kept educating and changing minds during those 5 years and then when we finally ratified same sex marriage less people would have died.
End result is that I'm glad same sex marriage exists.  &lt;3
