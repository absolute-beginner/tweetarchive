Text of the tweet: Not every fan can or will contribute.  That's ok.  Just by watching they are helping.

But someone who doesnt want you to make money? To literally take money from ads and turn it into content for free?

Those people are not fans.

They are petty. Jealous.  Spiteful.  Ignore them.
