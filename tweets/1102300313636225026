Text of the tweet: @hankgreen @AHumbleTalent Exactly.  Having gone through this exact thing where a joke I made during a live stream was taken out of context.

You apologize for hurt feelings first.  Always.

You explain the situation.  Show the context.

Then try to do better.

"Its just a joke. Fuck off" wont fly.
