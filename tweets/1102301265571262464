Text of the tweet: @hankgreen @AHumbleTalent The entire purpose of edgy humor, imho, is to get you to think.

Take Dave Chappelle's "black white supremacist" sketch.

It's a deep deconstruction American racism and while being hilarious is thought provoking.

If a joke is ONLY offensive, without that function, its worthless.
