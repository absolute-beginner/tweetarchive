Text of the tweet: Hot take:

One of the things that seems to upset people the most is forgiveness.

I forgave my abusers.  My rapist.  The people who mock me online.

This seems to not just confuse but upset the people who hate me.

Life is too short to waste it on hate.

You will learn this 1 day
