Text of the tweet: @jwatsonv I obvously didn't.  During mediation they asked us to sign an NDA, promising we wouldn't slander each other on social media.  It asked us to delete social media during the divorce proceedings.  I signed it.  I'm not sure that she ever did.

The rest is their narrative spin, ofc.
