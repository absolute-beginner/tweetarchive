Text of the tweet: So for about a year the internet tortured and boycotted Johnny Depp based on rumors that he abused his wife.

Turns out he didn't.  not only that, but it turns out his wife abused HIM.  He took the fall to protect his abuser and y'all crucified him.

Do better, internet.

Please.
