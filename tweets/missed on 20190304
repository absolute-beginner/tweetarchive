Text of the tweet: Welp....

My cpap died today.

Talked to my doctor abs they said they can see me in april.

Hoping that changes cause I think you die without months of sleep.

Maybe I lost enough weight to sleep without one.

Time to find out!

Text of the tweet: Again it's obviously not jealousy. I don't know why people insist on projecting that to this.

 It was genuine surprise. But after watching the review I see why it took 2 years to make it is amazing.

 You guys should watch it and set of hating on me lol

Text of the tweet: With untreated sleep apnea I was literally dying.

 I had a resting heart rate of a 130 beats a minute with my heart skipping every 5th beat.

 After just 2 nights on my C pap it was like night and day. My heart regulated. I was able to concentrate again. It was amazing

Text of the tweet: I know we are mourning the loss of Luke Perry.

But the frontman for the band Prodigy, Keith Flint took his own life over the weekend. Age 49.

It is always so sad when a celebrity takes their own life.  Someone who was so depressed fame and fortune could not save them from it.

Text of the tweet: I know that many people who read this don't really understand depression.

 Some of you think it doesn't even exist.

But I hope that when someone who is reached the pinnacle of their career choice takes their own life it can show you how devastating the disease actually is.

Text of the tweet: With depression people are taught to hide in plain sight. We are taught to fake it till you make it.  We are taught to pretend we aren't suffering to comfort others.

I imagine Keith Flint was very good at doing this because he seemed good at everything he tried to do.
